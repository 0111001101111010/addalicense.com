# What's this about?

We want to help developers choose a license for their source code.

If you already know what you're doing and have a license you prefer to use, that's great! We're not here to change your mind. But if you are bewildered by the large number of OSS license choices, maybe we can help.

Once you find a license you enjoy from [choosealicense.com](http:/www.choosealicense.com), this site will help you apply it to all your public repositories.

## Help us improve it

Addalicense.com isn't just about open source, the site itself is open source as well. See something you think could be done better? Feel free to [fork the project](https://github.com/gjtorikian/addalicense.com) on GitHub and submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

We are not lawyers. Well, most of us anyways. It is not the goal of this site to provide legal advice. The goal of this site is to provide a starting point to help you make an informed choice by providing information on popular open source licenses. If you have any questions regarding the right license for your code or any other legal issues relating to it, it's always best to consult with a professional.
